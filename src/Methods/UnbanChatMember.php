 * Use this method to unban a previously kicked user in a supergroup or channel. The user will not return to the group
 * or channel automatically, but will be able to join via link, etc. The bot must be an administrator for this to work.
 * By default, this method guarantees that after the call the user is not a member of the chat, but will be able to
 * join it. So if the user is a member of the chat they will also be removed from the chat. If you don't want this,
 * use the parameter only_if_banned. Returns True on success.
